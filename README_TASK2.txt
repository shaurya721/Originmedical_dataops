README file for task 2: 

# Technologies and Tools Used

MySQL Workbench (ER Diagram generation via reverse engineering)
SQLite / MySQL (Database interaction)
Python (Data processing and analysis)
Pandas (Handling and transforming data)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualizing insights)


# Steps Followed

1. Identifying Table Relationships
The ER Diagram was generated using MySQL Workbench through Database → Reverse Engineering.
Relationships between tables were documented in a text file.

2. ER Diagram Creation
The ER Diagram was saved and included in the final output.

3. Data Consolidation into CSV
SQL queries were used to extract relevant data from multiple tables.
The data was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and exported as consolidated_data.csv.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The Jupyter Notebook contains:
Data cleaning & preprocessing
Summary statistics & visualizations
Insights from the dataset


# Expected Output Files

relationships between tables.txt – Contains identified relationships between tables.
ER diagram pdf/ER diagram  – Entity Relationship Diagram.
consolidated_data.csv – Consolidated data from all tables.
TASK2origin_medical.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with EDA results.
